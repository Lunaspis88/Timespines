### Fish time!
 * Data collection continues
 * Richard will focus on collecting and formating the data from Sallan and Galimberti 2015 Nature (http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6262/812.full)
 * Marco will focus on collecting and formating the data from Clarke et al 2016 PNAS (http://www.pnas.org/content/113/41/11531.abstract)	
 * Thomas will focus on collecting and formating the data from Price et al 2015 Proc B (http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1819/20151428)

### Data collection protocol:
 * Don't worry about the type of size measurement per sites (length vs mass). We well be measuring things in units of standard deviation so the only important thing is to be consistent per sites.
 * Start pushing any good-ish data on GitHub (everybody has push access).

### Analysis protocol
 * We can use the data from the "Danger zone" paper as our baseline for extant ecosystems. We will do some sensitivity analysis (rarefaction) on it.
 * We can use any good fish lagerstatten as our base expectation: fishes are easy to deal with (they all predate-ish, they are all tube-like-ish, they are all blue and swim-in-the-water-ish)

Next meeting/deadline on the 20th of February.

### Data collection protocol refinement:
 * For body mass/length measurements, always go with the maximum
 * For body mass/length estimates, use regressions from the closest relative group you can find
 * When partial (but identifiable) bits are found for a species, use estimates from its genus (if possible)
 * If just a small part (femur head, teeth, etc...) is available without more info, put `NA` everywhere
 
Next meeting/deadline on the 16th of January (we suggested two sites to be properly collected and submitted on GitHub by then).
