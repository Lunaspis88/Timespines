> More fish!
 * Lauren is joining the team with great idea and nice data! Yay!
 * We simplify the project for a first pass:
 	* the idea will be to only look at fish groups that have a switch-on/switch-off of body armour
 	* body armour (presence/absence) can now be measured relatively from within the group (is there a change or not)
 	* we can then measure the change in body in the group, through time for each gain/loss
 		* Carefull there to adjust the change in body mass by correcting for the general trend in body mass (increase).
 	* one idea of the analysis would then be to check whether there is an increase/decrease in body mass related to gain/loss in armour through time (if danger zone, we would expect an increase/decrease but not no changes).
 * These are all really exciting ideas, we should try to find some meeting grants we could apply for organising a timespines meeting in real life.

Next meeting some time late August?

 * Rafael is joining the team!
 * We keep collecting data from last meeting
 * Thomas will get some analysis done for the BES Macro meeting

> Fish time!
 * Data collection continues
 * Richard will focus on collecting and formating the data from Sallan and Galimberti 2015 Nature (http://science.sciencemag.org/content/350/6262/812.full)
 * Marco will focus on collecting and formating the data from Clarke et al 2016 PNAS (http://www.pnas.org/content/113/41/11531.abstract)	
 * Anna will focus on collecting and formating the data from Price et al 2015 Proc B (http://rspb.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/282/1819/20151428)

> Data collection protocol:
 * Don't worry about the type of size measurement per sites (length vs mass). We well be measuring things in units of standard deviation so the only important thing is to be consistent per sites.
 * Start pushing any good-ish data on GitHub (everybody has push access).

> Analysis protocol
 * We can use the data from the "Danger zone" paper as our baseline for extant ecosystems. We will do some sensitivity analysis (rarefaction) on it.
 * We can use any good fish lagerstatten as our base expectation: fishes are easy to deal with (they all predate-ish, they are all tube-like-ish, they are all blue and swim-in-the-water-ish)

Next meeting/deadline on the 20th of February.

> Data collection protocol refinement:
 * For body mass/length measurements, always go with the maximum
 * For body mass/length estimates, use regressions from the closest relative group you can find
 * When partial (but identifiable) bits are found for a species, use estimates from its genus (if possible)
 * If just a small part (femur head, teeth, etc...) is available without more info, put `NA` everywhere
 
Next meeting/deadline on the 16th of January (we suggested two sites to be properly collected and submitted on GitHub by then).
