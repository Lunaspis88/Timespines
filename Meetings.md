### Data collection protocol refinement:
 * For body mass/length measurements, always go with the maximum
 * For body mass/length estimates, use regressions from the closest relative group you can find
 * When partial (but identifiable) bits are found for a species, use estimates from its genus (if possible)
 * If just a small part (femur head, teeth, etc...) is available without more info, put `NA` everywhere
 
Next meeting/deadline on the 16th of January (we suggested two sites to be properly collected and submitted on GitHub by then).
